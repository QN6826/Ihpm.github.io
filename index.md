With the issuance of the national three-child policy, the field of female 
reproduction has attracted more and more attention. To care for female reproductive 
health and help the implementation of the government's three child policy, we have 
proposed an intelligent home pregnancy preparation management method based on 
multimodal data fusion, namely FAM (Fertility Awareness Method, FAM). This method 
introduces big data, multimodal data fusion and image recognition technology. By 
inputting multi-modal data such as menstrual cycle, basal body temperature, ovulation 
test paper and cervical mucus of the pregnant woman, it can automatically predict the 
ovulation day and menstrual period information of the pregnant woman. This improves 
the pregnancy success rate of pregnant women, breaks the limitations of the traditional 
method of finding the ovulation day through monomodal data, and facilitates the 
monitoring of pregnant women at home. Finally, compared with the single-mode 
method qualitatively and quantitatively, the preliminary experimental results show that 
the accuracy of FAM method in identifying ovulation date is as high as 89%, and the 
accuracy in predicting menstrual period is as high as 93%, and the pregnancy success 
rate of pregnant women can be increased three times in at least nine cycles.
